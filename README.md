## Hopkins Film School Registration Form
### Introduction
This is an assignment that I use Visual C# 2022 to create a form.

### Business Scenario
*Hopskins Film School* is designed around a series of classes that are available for the participants, who are 
actors, producers, directors, and other individuals involved in independent filmmaking, to register to attend. 
Registrations are either telephoned to the school office or emailed to the school's email address. Currently, 
all registration are written down on paper forms by school personnel. The school direct wants to convert this 
paper-based registration system into a software program that will run on the computer in the school office.
